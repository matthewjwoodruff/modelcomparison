Compare two versions of the model underlying the general aviation aircraft product family design problem (GAA problem).

## What We Expect to See

We're expecting that optimizing an expanded version of the problem (using the General Aviation Synthesis Program, GASP) that includes integer variables will give us access to new and better solutions.
The point being that this points out the tradeoff inherent to metamodeling --- you're always sacrificing accuracy for ease of optimization and analysis.
That point, though, is totally straightforward.
Venkataraman and Haftka (2004) even give examples of exactly this, and their paper was published a decade ago.

We need to make a more complicated point.
Changing models, from a less complex to a more complex model, opens up new possibilities for making hypotheses about the problem.
That is, you can do different kinds of *learning* with a more complex model.
