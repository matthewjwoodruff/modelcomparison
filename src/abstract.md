# Abstract

Steady increases in computer power have made it possible to adopt more computationally expensive models in conceptual design studies.
    This study examines the new problem formulations that using a more computationally expensive model makes possible for the benchmark general aviation product family design problem.
    Many studies have explored the general aviation aircraft product family design problem using a polynomial regression model based on the behavior of the General Aviation Synthesis Program (GASP).
    This study, in contrast, presents results from the GASP model itself.
    These include not only single- and multi-objective optimization results from the same problem formulations used with the regression model, but also an exploration of several mixed-integer problem formulations that become available when the full GASP model is used.
    In addition to multi-objective optimization, these mixed-integer problem formulations are subjected to global sensitivity analysis to characterize their interaction with the GASP model.
    The results of this study emphasize the importance of exploring multiple competing hypotheses about a design optimization problem, highlighting the sensitivity of design optimality to problem formulation.
