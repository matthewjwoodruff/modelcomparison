<!--
To do Monday morning:

Look for multi-objective EGO-like approaches.
Start with that "book" (dissertation?) I dug up the other day.  (Forrester 2009, in Dropbox.)
Also Chris Schumaker's groups, and in particular her star post-doc. (?)
Also multi-fidelity modeling, surrogate modeling, Tim's work, Tim's latest book.

This is all so that I have a firm idea what I'm proposing, because I want to start drafting the proposal Monday afternoon.
