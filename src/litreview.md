# Literature Review

I think JMD is a good journal to target for this paper.
    They do lots of metamodeling papers, and they also have some more touchy-feely stuff about design novelty.
    Maybe even possible (although worthwhile?) to get in a technical brief on the difficulties of getting GASP up and running.

Next up, EJOR.

* What is a model for?
* How does it interact with problem formulation?
    - In terms of solutions produced
    - In terms of formulations available
* What's interesting about this study?
* What do I want people to do after reading it?
    - Try more problem formulations?
    - Try different models?

I think what I really need to do here is figure out what the state of the literature is.
    I'll start by looking at the summaries I did on SMO.
    Other places to look:

* Who has cited Tsoukias?  Possibly relevant.
* Does EJOR publish anything relevant?
* How about the MOEA crowd?
* Tim has mentioned Journal of Mech Design.
* Also seach around for multi-fidelity modeling, surrogate modeling, kriging, regression, etc.
* Sensitivity analysis lit might be relevant?  Especially if somebody's done SA on metamodels.
    Other than me, of course.

I'll be looking for:

* Multi-fidelity modeling
* Problem formulation
* Other stuff?  I don't really know what I'm looking for.  Similar studies, I suppose.
    - Compare solution sets from model and metamodel. (I'm sure this has been done.)
    - Compare formulations from model and metamodel.  (I'm not sure this has been done.)

Let's take this next-to-last point as a start.
    I'm looking for papers that *compare a model and a metamodel*, because that's what I do too.
    This will be a natural jumping-off point in the literature, it's clearly the most related body of work.
    I imagine there's a good deal of error estimation and so forth.

So the question is, do I want to start with papers that are about *developing* metamodels, or papers that are about *using existing* metamodels?  I'm not sure the latter category exists, really.

Alternatively, do I want to just pull the latest number from EJOR, Evolutionary Computation, IEEE Trans Evolutionary Computation, and JMD? Also simulation opt lit, Proc. WinterSim and perhaps others?
    Not necessarily in that order.

I'm going to take the latter route.  We'll see what emerges.
