# Abstract

* What is a model for?
* How does it interact with problem formulation?
    - In terms of solutions produced
    - In terms of formulations available
* What's interesting about this study?
* What do I want people to do after reading it?
    - Try more problem formulations?
    - Try different models?

I think what I really need to do here is figure out what the state of the literature is.
    I'll start by looking at the summaries I did on SMO.
    Other places to look:

* Who has cited Tsoukias?  Possibly relevant.
* Does EJOR publish anything relevant?
* How about the MOEA crowd?
* Tim has mentioned Journal of Mech Design.
* Also seach around for multi-fidelity modeling, surrogate modeling, kriging, regression, etc.
* Sensitivity analysis lit might be relevant?  Especially if somebody's done SA on metamodels.
    Other than me, of course.

I'll be looking for:

* Multi-fidelity modeling
* Problem formulation
* Other stuff?  I don't really know what I'm looking for.  Similar studies, I suppose.
    - Compare solution sets from model and metamodel. (I'm sure this has been done.)
    - Compare formulations from model and metamodel.  (I'm not sure this has been done.)
