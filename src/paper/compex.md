# Computational Experiment

Demonstrate several iterations of constructive problem framing,
each with its own variations on the process, to show how
different ways of formulating and evaluating hypotheses are
valid.

## Strategies to exhibit

These strategies will be combined in some iterations.

1.  *Initial information.*
    We, like most people, already have a good deal of information
    about the problem.
    This iteration shows how we use existing knowledge to form
    initial hypotheses.

2.  *Visualization.*
    We probably do this every time, unless we create a
    formulation that breaks the MOEA.
    Display our trademark visuals for comparing formulations ---
    scatter / glyph plot and parallel coordinate, as well as
    anything new that comes up.
    Visualization needs to be emphasized as a central tool for
    forming and evaluating hypotheses.

2.  *Full iteration.*
    Optimize, visualize, compare solutions, form a new
    hypothesis.

3.  *Branching.*
    Form multiple hypotheses at the same time and compare them.

4.  *Short-cut.*
    Evaluate hypotheses based on existing model evaluations, and
    decide whether or not to optimize them.
    Use ancillary Pareto sorting and objective re-evaluation 

5.  *Carry-forward.*
    Use existing model evaluations to generate an initial archive
    for a new problem formulation.

6.  *Emergent Strategies.*
    Things I haven't thought of yet that emerge from the process.

## Matrix Formalism?

We have an opportunity to apply Curtis and Mattson's matrix
formalism for formulation space exploration in the model
reevaluation script.
