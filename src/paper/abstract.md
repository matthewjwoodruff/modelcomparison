# Abstract

Steady increases in computer power have made it possible to use more
computationally expensive models in conceptual design optimization
studies.
    These more complex models present new opportunities for problem
    formulations that exploit features not present in lower-fidelity
    models.
    In the past, many studies have explored the benchmark general
    aviation aircraft product family design problem using a simple
    polynomial regression model based on the behavior of the more
    computationally expensive General Aviation Synthesis Program
    (GASP).
    This study, in contrast, explores the problem formulation
    opportunities presented by the GASP model itself.
    These include not only single- and multi-objective optimization
    results from the same problem formulations used with the
    regression model, but also an exploration of several mixed-integer
    problem formulations that become available when the full GASP
    model is used.
    In addition to multi-objective optimization, these mixed-integer
    problem formulations are subjected to global sensitivity analysis
    to characterize their interaction with the GASP model.
    The results of this study emphasize the importance of exploring
    multiple competing hypotheses about a design optimization problem,
    highlighting the sensitivity of design optimality to problem
    formulation.
