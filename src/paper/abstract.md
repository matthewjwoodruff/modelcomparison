Many Objective Visual Analytics: A Case Study in Constructive Problem
Framing

This paper presents a case study in which the Many Objective Visual
Analytics (MOVA) conceptual framework for design optimization informs
the constructive framing of a product family design problem.
    Constructive problem framing is a process that starts by
    acknowledging that the problem under consideration is not fully
    understood, treating the problem's formulation and even its basic
    assumptions as fluid and subject to revision by the designer.
    Learning about the problem leads to changes to the designer's
    assumptions and problem formulation, and ultimately to the
    selection of a design.
    The selected case study revisits the General Aviation Aircraft
    product family design problem (GAA Problem), previously studied
    with computationally inexpensive response surface models, using an
    aircraft design synthesis model instead.
    A complex model makes it possible to explore a wide variety of new
    formulations for the GAA Problem, while modern computing hardware
    and the cutting-edge Borg optimization framework makes it possible
    to optimize them.
    This paper reports the iterative formulation and reformulation of
    the GAA Problem, describing the process by which new formulation
    hypotheses emerge and give rise to new designs.
