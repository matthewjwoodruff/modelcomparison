    abstractNote={Many scientists and engineers now use the paradigms of evolutionary computation (genetic agorithms, evolution strategies, evolutionary programming, genetic programming, classifier systems, and combinations or hybrids thereof) to tackle problems that are either intractable or unrealistically time consuming to solve through traditional computational strategies. Recently there have been vigorous initiatives to promote cross-fertilization between the EC paradigms, and also to combine these paradigms with other approaches such as neural networks to create hybrid systems with enhanced capabilities. To address the need for speedy dissemination of new ideas in these fields, and also to assist in cross-disciplinary communications and understanding, Oxford University Press and the Institute of Physics have joined forces to create a major reference publication devoted to EC fundamentals, models, algorithms and applications. This work is intended to become the standard reference resource for the evolutionary computation community. The Handbook of Evolutionary Computation will be available in loose-leaf print form, as well as in an electronic version that combines both CD-ROM and on-line (World Wide Web) acess to its contents. Regularly published supplements will be available on a subscription basis.},

    abstract={Interactive exploration of multidimensional data sets is challenging because: (1) it is difficult to comprehend patterns in more than three dimensions, and (2) current systems often are a patchwork of graphical and statistical methods leaving many researchers uncertain about how to explore their data in an orderly manner. We offer a set of principles and a novel rank-by-feature framework that could enable users to better understand distributions in one (1D) or two dimensions (2D), and then discover relationships, clusters, gaps, outliers, and other features. Users of our framework can view graphical presentations (histograms, boxplots, and scatterplots), and then choose a feature detection criterion to rank 1D or 2D axis-parallel projections. By combining information visualization techniques (overview, coordination, and dynamic query) with summaries and statistical methods users can systematically examine the most important 1D and 2D axis-parallel projections. We summarize our Graphics, Ranking, and Interaction for Discovery (GRID) principles as: (1) study 1D, study 2D, then find features (2) ranking guides insight, statistics confirm. We implemented the rank-by-feature framework in the Hierarchical Clustering Explorer, but the same data exploration principles could enable users to organize their discovery process so as to produce more thorough analyses and extract deeper insights in any multidimensional data application, such as spreadsheets, statistical packages, or information visualization tools.},

    abstract={Describes data exploration techniques designed to classify DNA sequences. Several visualization and data mining techniques were used to validate and attempt to discover new methods for distinguishing coding DNA sequences (exons) from non-coding DNA sequences (introns). The goal of the data mining was to see whether some other, possibly non-linear combination of the fundamental position-dependent DNA nucleotide frequency values could be a better predictor than the AMI (average mutual information). We tried many different classification techniques including rule-based classifiers and neural networks. We also used visualization of both the original data and the results of the data mining to help verify patterns and to understand the distinction between the different types of data and classifications. In particular, the visualization helped us develop refinements to neural network classifiers, which have accuracies as high as any known method. Finally, we discuss the interactions between visualization and data mining and suggest an integrated approach.},
