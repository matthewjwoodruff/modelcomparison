Abstract
========

This study takes advantage of the last decade's advances in computer power to revisit a model that was formerly too computationally expensive to optimize. Many studies have optimized the general aviation aircraft product family design problem using a polynomial regression model based on the behavior of the General Aviation Synthesis Program (GASP). This study, in contrast, presents optimization results from the GASP model itself. These results include not only single- and multi-objective optimization results from the same problem formulations used with the regression model, but also an exploration of several mixed-integer problem formulations that become available when the full GASP model is used. In addition to multi-objective optimization, these mixed-integer problem formulations are subjected to global sensitivity analysis to characterize their interaction with the GASP model. The results of this study emphasize the importance of exploring multiple competing hypotheses about a design optimization problem, highlighting the sensitivity of design optimality to problem formulation.
