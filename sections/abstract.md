Abstract
========

Steady increases in computer power have made it possible to use more computationally expensive models in conceptual design optimization studies. These more complex models present new opportunities for problem formulations that exploit features not present in lower-fidelity models. In the past, many studies have explored the benchmark general aviation aircraft product family design problem using a simple polynomial regression model based on the behavior of the more computationally expensive General Aviation Synthesis Program (GASP). This study, in contrast, explores the problem formulation opportunities presented by the GASP model itself. These include not only single- and multi-objective optimization results from the same problem formulations used with the regression model, but also an exploration of several mixed-integer problem formulations that become available when the full GASP model is used. In addition to multi-objective optimization, these mixed-integer problem formulations are subjected to global sensitivity analysis to characterize their interaction with the GASP model. The results of this study emphasize the importance of exploring multiple competing hypotheses about a design optimization problem, highlighting the sensitivity of design optimality to problem formulation.
